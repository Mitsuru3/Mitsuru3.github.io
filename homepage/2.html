          <p style="margin-top: 20px;">You're probably never going to see it or know it was there, an almost unlabeled stretch of concrete and asphalt. In the city that never sleeps it's an outcast, a misfit, nowhere. But you may think you’re somewhere special because when you enter, you are filled with… nothing. </p>
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2"> </h4>
          <p>New york is a metropolis, filled to the brim with people, sounds, sights, but that's not New york. The city is made of people but not always where you'll find them, and sometimes where you won't. Plenty of people talk about New York being bustling, disgusting, messy, a shithole. But when I walk through Monroe Place, for some reason, I see nothing. In fact, if that was the definition of New york, I’d be in a different country going down that street. Monroe Place isn’t the rest of NYC but even so it's not out of place. These places still hold a resemblance of what a NYC street should be, rugged slabs of bluestone, tree roots lifting concrete for space, buildings of generations past. Yet it feels different, the people have gone, the howl of cars is muted by the rustle of leaves, like a piece of the puzzle is missing. A distance who’s continued worth is not from what it possesses but what it does not. And within such a concrete jungle it creates a statement what is NYC without it. Monroe place is in New York, it's in downtown Brooklyn, not a long way from the Brooklyn bridge. New York isn’t a busy crowded metropolis, it's more than that, within those high rises and concrete walls are places that defy the areas nearby, a place so vast you’ll never see so many people yet so many. You'll never see someone’s something even if you are in it, because all that’s there is you and nothing. Nobody is with you, no one can tell you, because a New yorker’s something is never yours. In a place of so many somewheres that it becomes suffocating how many of these somewheres actually matter. Millions have seen the Grand Central ceiling, millions more have seen the Statue of Liberty, ventured into Times Square, Soho, crossed the Brooklyn Bridge, spent hours in Central park. What's been said about them can be found in many photo albums, everyone sees the somewhere but not the nowheres</p>
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3"> </h4>
          <p>But, I know which house marks the summit of the sidewalk, I know which concrete slabs are disheveled from the tree root’s wrath. The building at the end wears the drab green of scaffolding never changing, iron black, the fountain where goldfish open their mouths to teasing hand and empty palm. The black goldfish, once too small to see, drifts under overflowing flowering iron where water no longer flows. A brick line jutting between doorways as if a mere grasp to a true division. Faux columns down a courthouse insignificant. The illusionary slope of the low wall circulating the courthouse facade, a climb ever closer to the elusive sky. Flowers of marble, an adventurous child’s hardest challenge preventing the complete navigation of that magical wall. Sunken doorways, an awning’s two golden poles, serrated wall, stop sign. But of course it's nothing, it's nothing to others, it's nothing to anyone, it's nothing to me. It was nothing since I walked through it the first time. Nothing is in NYC as it is part of NYC and so is nowhere and nobody. Nothing isn't just in Monroe Place it is where nowhere is, maybe where nobody is. </p>
